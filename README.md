# landing-page

I will be creating the landing page for a Tea website using HTML and CSS.


I've completed the first iteration of the landing page project. 

Still could make the page more customized. Undecided on that front.

It was simpler than I was expecting. I resisted the urge to find solutions in the other student projects. Google was a big help.
